\textbf{Some instructions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Please follow the instructions for homework submission that are given in the syllabus and on the HW webpage.
    %%%\item Do not forget \textbf{to staple your HW and attach the cover sheet}.
    \item In the questions given below \textsf{\bf BLOCH 1.4.18} refers to Bloch's book section 1.4, problem no. 18.
    \item Please use the \LaTeX~ file that I have provided on the homework page to typeset your homework.
    \item Please name the files as follows: Suppose Carl F. Gauss was submitting HW \#\hwnumber, then the files should be named as \textit{CGaussHW\hwnumber.tex} and \textit{CGaussHW\hwnumber.pdf}.
    \item \LaTeX{} users:
       \begin{itemize}
            \item Please upload both the \LaTeX and PDF files and follow the instructions written above for naming the files.
            \item Use the {\blue ``problem'' environment} for questions and the {\blue ``solution'' environment} to type the solutions. For example
            {\magenta
            \begin{verbatim}
                 \begin{solution}
                     You can start typing your solution here.........
                 \end{solution}
            \end{verbatim}
            }
             will give you the following output:

                \begin{solution}
                You can start typing your solution here.........
                \end{solution}

            \item For writing proofs you can use the following \LaTeX~ environment
               {\blue
                \begin{verbatim}
                    \begin{proof}

                    \end{proof}
                    \end{verbatim}
                    }
                It will give you the following
                \begin{proof}
                My first proof is quite awesome
                \end{proof}
        \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{center}
\textbf{\blue For writing proofs:}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declare what kind of proof you are going to use.
    \item In case you are proving an equivalent statement then before you prove anything first state that equivalent statement and justify why your statement is equivalent to the statement given in the problem.
    \item You should use complete sentences in English to express each step.
    \item Your proof should read like a paragraph and not a bulleted list, i.e. the sentences should have a flow and structure.
    \item Avoid using quantifiers within the sentences, i.e. instead of writing: ``$\exists x \in \bbR$ such that $\ldots$'', you should write ``there exists a real number $x$ such that $\ldots$.''

Let us recall the definition of a \textbf{partition of a set $S$}.
    \begin{define}
        \label{def:1}
        A collection of sets $\mathcal{C}$ is a partition of set $S$ if the following hold:

                \item Every set in the collection $\mathcal{C}$ is non-empty.
                \item For every two sets $A$ and $B$ in the collection $\mathcal{C}$, either they are equal or they are disjoint.
                \item $\displaystyle \bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X = S$, i.e the union of all the sets in the collection make up the entire set $S$.
            \end{enumerate}

    Answer the following:

    \item Which of the following are partitions of $S=\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$? For each collection of subsets that is not a partition of $S$, explain your answer.

 \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*).]
    \item Give a geometrical description of the sets $A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{\pi}$ and $A_{-\sqrt{2}}$. You don't need to draw pictures/graphs but some description in words is expected which can convey the geometry of the set.
    \item Find $\displaystyle \bigcap_{t \in I} A_t$? You don't need to prove the answer.
    \item Will the point $(-2,3) \in \displaystyle \bigcup_{t \in I} A_t$? Prove or disprove.

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of sets. A set $S$ is called a \textbf{BIGBRO Set} of $\mathcal{F}$ if it satisfies both the properties \textbf{P1 \& P2} listed below.
\begin{description}
    \item[P1:] $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \power[S]$.
    \item[P2:] $\forall \, T \, \big[(\mathcal{F} \subseteq \power[T]) \, \longrightarrow \, (S \subseteq T)\big]$.

    \item How many different \textbf{BIGBRO} sets did you find in each of the problems?
    \item Now we will do this problem \textbf{for a general family of sets} $\mathcal{F}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be \textbf{any} non-empty family of sets. Prove that there \colorbox{yellow}{exists exactly one} (\textsf{unique}) set $S$ that can be the \textbf{BIGBRO} set of $\mathcal{F}$.

        \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=red!65!black,title={Hint}]
        First you have to show the existence of such a set $S$. From the examples above you might be able to guess what that should be. Then to show uniqueness, assume there are two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ that satisfy the conditions given , then show that $S_1=S_2$.
